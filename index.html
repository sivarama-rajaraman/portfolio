                                Novel Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by the new Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome 
                                Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that originated in Wuhan in the Hubei province in China and has spread 
                                worldwide. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak a pandemic on March 11, 2020. 
                                The disease is rapidly affecting worldwide population with statistics quickly falling out of date. 
                                As of April 12, 2020, there are over 1.8 million confirmed cases reported globally with over 100,000 
                                reported deaths. Lung disease that causes difficulty in breathing has been reported as an early 
                                indicator along with hyperthermia in the COVID-19 infected population. The lung abnormalities 
                                caused by non-2019-nCOV viruses are observed as peripheral or hilar and visually similar to, 
                                yet often distinct from, viral pneumonia and other bacterial pathogens. In this project, we 
                                propose several measures to effectively detect COVID-19 disease manifestations in Chest X-rays.

                                According to the World Health Organization (WHO), tuberculosis (TB) remains the most

                                infectious disease in the world. Analysis of frontal chest X-rays (CXR) is one of the
                                most
                                popular
                                methods for initial TB screening, however, the method is impacted by the lack of experts
                                for

                                prominence in image classification, detection, and localization tasks because they are
                                highly scalable and
                                deliver superior results with end-to-end feature extraction and classification. In this
                                study, we evaluated
                                the performance of CNN based DL models for population screening using frontal CXRs. We
                                worked with
                                the public and private CXR collections, archived at NLM. We observed that CNNs are a
                                promising

                                that worked
                                with hand-engineered and deep CNN features toward the process of improving the detection
                                accuracy to
                                advance research in TB detection. The results obtained with the stacked model ensemble
                                were
                                found to be
                                promising compared to the state-of-the-art in TB detection. Training metrics are not

                                reliable and
                                standard visualization techniques like feature and activation visualization, saliency
                                maps,
                                partial
                                occlusion measurements, and class activation maps (CAM) help in providing a sanity check
                                on
                                the
                                learning strategy. Saliency maps provide intuition of attention and help to analyze the
                                most
                                influential
                                features. Partial occlusion studies help in identifying whether the trained model is
                                actually classifying
                                based on the task-specific features and not the surrounding context and gaining a clear
                                understanding of
                                the learned behavior of the model for the underlying task. CAM helps to visualize
                                discriminative image
                                regions used by the trained model to identify an image category. We performed these
                                visualizations to
                                understand the learned parameters, model behavior and optimized the model architecture
                                and

                                every year.
                                Chest X-ray (CXR) analysis is routinely performed to diagnose the disease.
                                Computer-aided diagnostic
                                (CADx) tools aim to supplement decision-making. These tools process the handcrafted

                                convolutional neural network (CNN) extracted image features for visual recognition.
                                However, CNNs are
                                perceived as black boxes since their performance lack explanations. This is a serious

                            <p>In this study, we investigated the usage of deep CNN models for automatic detection of
                                cardiomegaly in digital CXRs. We fine-tuned several deep CNN architectures to detect the
                                presence of
                                cardiomegaly in CXRs. Next, we introduced an alternative fine-tuning approach where we
                                first fully
                                trained an architecture with a large-scale CXR collection and fine-tuned the model with

                                NIH-CXR datasets. Based on our preliminary results, we observed the following: (a)

                                produced better results than prior rule-based approaches developed for cardiomegaly
                                detection; (b) our
                                preliminary test with alternative fine-tuning approach was promising; (iii) there was a
                                correlation between
                                the Softmax probability and severity of the disease.

                            <p>Respiratory diseases account for the majority of deaths and disabilities across the
                                world. Chest X-ray
                                (CXR) analysis remains a common part of the protocol for confirming lung abnormalities.
                                However, the
                                ratio of expert radiologists to the radiograph volume is continuing to increase leading
                                to severe backlogs
                                and interpretation delays. These issues can be mitigated by a computer-aided diagnostic
                                (CADx) system
                                to supplement decision-making and improve throughput while preserving and possibly

                                standard-of-care. These systems reportedly use handcrafted features and/or data-driven
                                algorithms like
                                deep learning (DL) to learn underlying data distributions. The remarkable success of

                                networks (CNN) toward image recognition tasks has made them a promising choice for

                                medical image analyses. Ensemble learning combines the predictions of multiple learning
                                algorithms to

                            <p>Medical imaging datasets are available in sparse due to privacy issues and the high cost
                                of annotations.
                                Data augmentation is a widely used practice in machine learning that helps in reduced
                                bias, overfitting
                                and improved model generalization. In this study, we evaluated the performance of

                                augmentation methods and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) toward synthesizing data

                                synthesize realistic samples. We observed that the traditional data augmentation

                                unsharp masking, Gaussian smoothing and minimum filtering helped in improved performance

                        <p> <b>Scientific Highlights: </b>Malaria is caused by parasites that are transmitted through
                            the bites of infected Anopheles
                            mosquitoes. With about 200 million cases worldwide and about 400,000 deaths per year,
                            malaria is a
                            major burden on global health. The current standard method for malaria diagnosis in the
                            field is light
                            microscopy of blood films. However, microscopic diagnostics is not standardized and depends
                            heavily on
                            the experience and skill of the microscopists. To improve malaria diagnostics, LHNCBC, in
                            collaboration
                            with NIHâs National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and Mahidol-Oxford
                            University, is developing a mobile application that runs on an Android phone for parasite
                            detection and
                            counting in blood films. Giemsa-stained thin blood smear slides from 150 P.
                            falciparum-infected and 50
                            healthy patients were collected and photographed at Chittagong Medical College Hospital,
                            Bangladesh.
                            The smartphoneâs built-in camera acquired images of slides for each microscopic field of
                            view. The
                            images were manually annotated by an expert slide reader at the Mahidol-Oxford Tropical
                            Medicine
                            Research Unit in Bangkok, Thailand. The de-identified images and annotations are archived at
                            NLM. We
                            applied a level-set based algorithm to detect and segment the red blood cells. We proposed
                            the advantages
                            offered through visualizing the features and activations in customized CNNs applied to the
                            challenge of
                            malaria cell classification. We evaluated the performance of customized and pre-trained CNN
                            based DL
                            models as feature extractors toward classifying parasitized and uninfected cells to aid in
                            improved disease
                            screening. We experimentally determined the optimal model layers for feature extraction from
                            the
                            underlying data. Statistical validation of the results demonstrated the use of pre-trained
                            CNNs as a
                            promising tool for feature extraction for this purpose.
                            CNN models are perceived as black boxes since there is a lack of understanding of the
                            learned
                            behavior from the underlying task of interest. This lack of transparency is a serious
                            drawback, particularly
                            in applications involving medical screening and diagnosis since poorly understood model
                            behavior could
                            adversely impact the process of decision-making. In this study, we highlighted the
                            advantages offered
                            through visualizing and understanding the weights, saliencies, CAM and ROI localizations in
                            CNNs
                            applied to the challenge of classifying parasitized and uninfected cells to aid in malaria
                            screening. We
                            provided an explanation on what made these models arrive at the classification decision. We
                            evaluated the
                            performance of different CNNs and statistically validated with a large-scale clinical
                            dataset at the patient
                            level. We observed that CNN models could serve as a promising classification tool for this
                            purpose.

                            be cancerous. We aimed to
                            develop a CADx tool for diagnosing skin tumors. The dermal images of three types including
                            benign
                            tumor, malignant melanoma, and normal moles were collected and preprocessed to remove hair
                            cells. A
                            contour based level set technique was applied to segment the lesion. Morphological features
                            were
                            extracted and a random subset method was used to perform feature selection. The
                            classification was
                            performed using classifiers including a multi-layer perceptron and support vector machine
                            (SVM). The
                            classification accuracy was found to be 94% and 96% respectively. We statistically validated
                            the
                            performance of the classifiers using one way ANOVA and Tukey post-hoc analyses.

                        <p> <b>Scientific Highlights: </b>Karyotyping is a specialized procedure that helps diagnosing
                            the genetic abnormalities and is one
                            of the fundamental techniques employed for studying the genetic information. Cytogeneticists
                            examine
                            the karyotypes to identify the presence of chromosomal pairs, and missing or rearranged
                            genetic materials
                            in the chromosomes. Automatic karyotyping packages are accounted to be 70% efficient, as
                            suggested by
                            the cytogenetic experts. However, these packages are found to have errors in counting due to
                            the presence
                            of unwanted components including stain, debris and interphase cells, chromosomal
                            misplacement,
                            chromosomal inversion and rejection that occurs due to occlusion of chromosomes. In this
                            study, we
                            attempted to resolve these limitations and improve the efficiency of automatic karyotyping
                            systems. We
                            proposed a novel, efficient method based on multi-directional block ranking to remove the
                            interphase
                            cells without affecting the metaphase spread of chromosomes. We also proposed a robust
                            algorithm based
                            on evolutionary computation methods to identify and resolve occlusion in an occluded
                            chromosomal
                            cluster. This reduced errors in an automatic karyotyping system due to incorrect
                            identification of partially
                            or totally hidden metaphase chromosomes. We also proposed a novel, efficient,
                            similarity-based classifier
                            that used only three features as used by the cytogeneticists in manual diagnosis of genetic
                            disorders. The
                            effectiveness of the work was evaluated with the standardized karyotype data obtained from
